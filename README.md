Blender only allows for uniform subdivision.
This operator enables you to select multiple segments and split them at custom parameters simultaneously.

### Bezier Intersection
Select exactly two segments to split them at their intersections.

### Bezier Circle
Add a bezier circle which completes the selected segment into a full circle.

### Bezier Length
Measures the arc length of the selected bezier segments.

### Bezier Offset
Adds poly traces with a defined offset to the selected bezier spline (all connected segments).
